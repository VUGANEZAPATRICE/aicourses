Dear Fellows,
Hope you are doing great!
I Wanted to inform the rubric on the This week Hackathon!
1. Write a program which takes array of urls for job-posting websites in Rwanda
   * https://www.jobinrwanda.com/  (Job Adverts)
   * https://www.umucyo.gov.rw  ( Tenders)
2. Web-scrap the content and put them in a pandas data-frame(i.e: the best structured dataframe wins ofcourse!)
3. Use regular expression and key-words to retrieve IT/Software related job/consultancy opportunities(Tenders).
4. Use EasyNMT to display the results in 50+ languages using wrapped state of art models
   * Practical Example for EasyNMT use:

COPEDU LTD was registered as a Microfinance Company in Rwanda Development Board (RDB) on February 21, 2013, with a certificate to perform microfinance services by the Central Bank of Rwanda (BNR) on 13th/03/2014.\\nOn 25th/01/2019, COPEDU LTD changed its name to COPEDU PLC following the provisions of Law N ° 17/2018 of 13/04/2018 governing commercial companies. This means that COPEDU PLC is a Public Limited Company that can call on the public for investments as shares.\\n\\n', '\\nWho we are\\nAt EarthEnable, we believe that our clients deserve our very best, that morning high-fives are the best way to start the day, and that the best ideas could come from any part of the company. We celebrate each other’s wins, learn from our setbacks, and are deeply proud of the impact we make every day. We believe that a clean, dust-free floor means more than living in a healthy home. It means pride and dignity in the place our customers most treasure: their homes. Being a part of our team means more than building floors: it means building an organization and building a better future for rural families.\\nWhat we do\\nEarthEnable is transforming the way people live, by making homes healthier for families across rural Rwanda. 80% of Rwandans live in homes with dirt floors which are dusty, unsanitary, and fertile breeding grounds for parasites and germs. While replacing a dirt floor with concrete has significant health benefits (e.g. reducing diarrhea by 50% and parasitic infections by 80%), concrete is unaffordable for many who need it.\\n\\nEarthEnable addresses this pressing and ubiquitous problem by selling high-quality, earthen floors that are 80% cheaper than concrete with 90% less embedded energy. Earthen floors are already prevalent in modern homes in the United States and are composed of natural materials (gravel, clay, sand, and laterite). EarthEnable trains and hires local masons to install the floors which are sealed using a proprietary drying oil that makes them waterproof, strong, and polished. In our first 3 years of operations, EarthEnable has installed over 40,000 square meters of flooring and employed over 200 Rwandese staff (and generated jobs and income for an additional 100 masons).\\n\\n', '', '', '\\nWater For People (WFP) is a global nonprofit working across nine countries, bringing together communities, local entrepreneurs, and governments to build and maintain water and sanitation services that will last.
